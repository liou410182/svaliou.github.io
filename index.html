    你好 有人缘<br>

    The past is all that you have accumulated as memory,the remembrace of things gone.<br>
    <hr>
    and the present is the past modifying itself to the future.<br>
    So you are the past memories, past remembrances, past accidents, the whole accumulation of the past.<br>
    You are that. You are the bundle of memories. That's a fact. If you had no memories, you don't exist.<br>
    The past is time. The past has been gathered through time.
    Memory is born from the past experience, which is, when I use the word 'past', it's already time.
    The past is experience knowledge, stored in the brain as memory, and from memory thought arises.<br>
    <br>
    So time, which is the past, and also memory which is the past, so time and thought are the same, they are not separate.<br>
